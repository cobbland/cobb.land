I wanted to test if posting straight from GitHub by creating and commiting a file is something reasonable to do. The editor on the mobile site is kinda trash, so I wouldn't want to do this often. But I do think it will work. (Just have to remember to pull the changes on my computer before I start messing around.)

Anyway, that's all. Bye.
