I have a confession to make. I lied. Sort of. In my previous post (<a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://cobb.land/posts/whos-a-blog-for/">Who's a blog for?</a>) I said I wasn't here for engagement or community. I stand by everything I said in the context of a blog having a comments section. But there is one area where engagement and community are something I really enjoy: being part of an ongoing conversation that spans multiple blogs and posts and authors and days.

Right now, the topic du jour is blog comments. And I've already read over half a dozen related posts, some (read: one) of which mentioned this very website. (The most recent of which, and maybe my favorite, was [Rabbit](https://jackalope.city/)'s [Blaugust Notes on Comments](https://talk.jackalope.city/talk/blaugust-notes-on-comments/).)

Normally, all of these related posts would be lost to me (especially without webmentions—more on that in a minute). But in the case of Blaugust, and thanks to [owl](https://godless-internets.org/about)'s [Blaugust 2025 OPML](https://godless-internets.org/2025/08/01/blaugust-2025-opml), I've added one hundred and fifty feeds to my reader. It's impossible to read everything coming through that firehose, but I have been at least skimming through those that look interesting.

Anyway. Something, something, transition...

**Webmentions<sup><a href=#1down id="1up">1</a></sup>!**

I just finished implementing webmentions on my own site. I can send 'em, I can receive 'em, and now I can even display 'em. If you look towards the bottom of each of my posts, you just might find links to where others have liked and commented upon them.

Now, I know what you're thinking: "Cobb, how is that any different from having a comments section?"

Because it is! Don't ask me questions! Nothing means anything!

By implementing webmentions, we can let each other know when our posts are in response or related to one another's. That way, relevant posts won't so easily get lost in the feed deluge. It's a handy way to connect, facilitating much more in depth conversations than those drive-by point-n-shoot comments section conversations—yuck.

Think about it: Would you rather have a quick and less thoughtful back and forth in the comments section on a random blog, or would you prefer to write your own carefully considered post in response? I choose the latter. And I hope you will, too.

Setting this whole thing up seemed daunting at first, but it actually wasn't too bad. I used [Webmention.io](https://webmention.io/) and [webmention.app](https://webmention.app/) for receiving and sending webmentions, as well as [Bridgy](https://brid.gy/) for connecting to Mastodon (and sometimes Bluesky). They all have pretty decent documentation. (And it might be even easier for you Wordpress people. I hear you have plugins and such.)

Send me webmentions!
