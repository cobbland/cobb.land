Looking back on the twenty twenty-five as I was making this list, I kept thinking of things I wanted to put on it, only to realize they're from two thousand twenty-four. This past year has blown by without so much as a hi-how-are-you. But here we are: Some of my favorite things.

Please let me know everything I got wrong.

**Best album**: *[Wolfroy Goes to Town](https://bonnieprincebilly.bandcamp.com/album/wolfroy-goes-to-town)* by Bonnie "Prince" Billy. I stopped using Spotify this year<sup><a href=#1down id="1up">1</a></sup>, and I have yet to settle on how I want to enjoy music going forward, so my listening has mostly been in the form of random CDs, and it's been mostly untracked. But if I had to guess which album I've listened to the most, I'd put money on this one. I enjoyed it fourteen years ago when it came out, and I enjoy it just as much now.

**Best book**: *[The Left Hand of Darkness](https://www.ursulakleguin.com/left-hand-darkness)* by Ursula K Le Guin. I didn't read enough this year, and I certainly didn't read enough new stuff. But I did reread one of my favorites.

**Best game console**: [Nintendo 3DS](https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Hardware/Nintendo-3DS-Family/Nintendo-3DS-Family-94560.html). Why didn't anyone tell me about this thing sooner? The 3DS came out during the decade and a half when I didn't play video games. I guess I missed out on some good stuff. Catching up now!

**Best Linux distro**: [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg) from Universal Blue. Listen. I love Linux. I've been using it as my main OS off an on since Hardy Heron. But I am still very much a Linux beginner. Bazzite has made things that used to be hard for me, very easy—namely playing games.<sup><a href=#2down id="2up">2</a></sup>

**Best meal**: Pla Lad Prik (ปลาราดพริก) from [Mom's Siam](https://momsiamrva.com) in Richmond, VA. You just cannot beat a crispy, spicy, tasty, whole fish. (Could have been spicier, though.)

**Best movie**: *[KPop Demon Hunters](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/803796-kpop-demon-hunters)*. Much like books, I didn't watch many movies this year. But this one definitely stands out in my memory. I was surprised by how good it was. And those songs are so catchy!

**Best piece of furniture**: [IVAR](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/ivar-2-section-shelving-unit-pine-s89407058/) from IKEA. Got the massive two-section unit that nearly goes up to the ceiling. Completely changed the functionality of our studio. Seriously.

**Best retro handheld**: [Miyoo Mini Plus](https://retrocatalog.com/retro-handhelds/miyoo-mini-plus). My first one was defective. My second one still feels janky. And yet, I really enjoy this little guy. Took it with me almost everywhere this year. I even played it some, too.

**Best show**: *[Star Wars: Andor](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/83867-andor)* (season 2). Nothing beats the original trilogy. After that, nothing beats the prequel trilogy (I was eleven when it came out—leave me alone). After that, and arguably "better" than some of both, is Andor. This show did things I hadn't realized were possible with Star Wars. And it has stayed with me.

**Best tabletop roleplaying game**: [Dolmenwood](https://necroticgnome.com/collections/dolmenwood) from Necrotic Gnome. Surprising absolutely no one. I've only run one session so far, but I can see this being one of my forever games.

**Best video game**: *[Hollow Knight](https://www.hollowknight.com)* from Team Cherry. I know I'm way late to the party on this one. But better late than never. This quickly became one of my favorites of all time. (Honorable mention and close second place goes to The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past—even later on that one.)

**Best website**: [cobb.land](https://cobb.land). I mean, just look at this place! How cool, right?

<p class="note footnote"><a href="#1up" id="1down">1</a>: There was a great article about how to quit Spotify posted by Brian Merchant of Blood in the Machine last month, but I'm not going to link to Substack. Here is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251218021237/https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/a-complete-guide-to-quitting-spotify">a Wayback Machine capture</a> instead.</p>
