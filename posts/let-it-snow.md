With a winter weather advisory in effect here in the foodhills of Appalachia, I'm feeling pretty festive. So, inspired by [Dávid's Snowfall post](https://blog.gridranger.dev/snowfall/) (and using most of [his code](https://framagit.org/gridranger/gridranger.frama.io/-/snippets/7593)), I added falling snow to this website.
