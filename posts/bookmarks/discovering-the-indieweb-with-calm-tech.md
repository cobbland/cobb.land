quote: "I reject the dead Internet theory: I see a vibrant Internet full of humans sharing their experiences and seeking connection. Degradation of the engagement-driven web is well underway, accelerated by AI slop. But the independent web works on a different incentive structure and is resistant to this effect. Humans inherently create, connect, and share: we always have and we always will. If you choose software that works in your interest you’ll find that it’s possible to make meaningful online connections without mental hazard."

Robert shares two great tools here (in addition to his beautiful vision of the internet): [Blog Quest](https://github.com/robalexdev/blog-quest) (for finding RSS feeds as you browse the web) and [StreetPass](https://streetpass.social) (the same but for finding Mastodon profiles). I've already installed them both.
