I've heard if monks making beer, wine, and even fruitcake, but never have I heard of an [order of monks making websites](https://web.archive.org/web/19971015192544/http://www.christdesert.org/noframes/script/script.html). I kind of love it. (Too bad [they're not still coding](https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/taming-demon).)
