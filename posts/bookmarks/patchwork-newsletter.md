quote: "A five-day journey in Moria requires how many pounds of food, water, and oil for light? According to the LoTR 5e game, 1 lb food and 5 lb water, and 4 lbs oil (if l lit continuously) gives 10 lbs/day or 50 lbs for 5 days. 100 lbs if you want to come back the same way. This is why lembas and Gandalf’s light cantrip were so important."

Another great recurring collection of TTRPG news, links, and discussion to add to the growing list (already containing [Indie RPG Newsletter](https://ttrpg.in), [Shiny TTRPG Links](https://seedofworlds.blogspot.com/search/label/weekly%20links), [OSR News Roundup](https://www.sabregamesandcards.com/blog), [CATMAIL](https://elmc.at/catmail-1/) \[new!\], and a few others on Substack so I won't link to them). A sad thing it highlights though is how much interesting conversation is missed because so much of it is trapped on Discord. (The quote above is a summary of one such discussion.) We need a return to forums! For such talk I recommend [The Cauldron](https://discourse.rpgcauldron.com). (I should really practice what I preach and post there more often.)
