quote: "Because at some point, it inevitably becomes treacherous. The master with a powerful pupil feels threatened, because the question isn’t, “Are they holding out on me” but “How much!?”. And the pupil who approaches their master’s power might start to covet the very library they helped to build. It’s no surprise that Wizards shut themselves in their towers, trusting no one at the gates for fear of assassins, trapping their lairs against intruders and thieves, and generally becoming secretive hoarders as rumors spread among the townsfolk… and so on."
