It hadn't occurred to me before reading this that HTTPS might not be a universally good thing, nor did I previously know the history of its push. Maybe blogs don't need it. Maybe most of the web doesn't need it. (But I'll be keeping it for now against my will because [Netlify enables it by default](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/07/02/all-new-sites-on-netlify-are-https-by-default/) and doesn't allow you to turn it off.)
