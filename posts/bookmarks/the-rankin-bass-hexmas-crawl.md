quote: "Today is the 12th and final day of Christmas (if you take down your tree and garlands before New Year’s, you are missing out on bonus Christmastime), so it is proper to roundup all the entries to the Merry Hexmas blogwagon that ran in December 2025."

I didn't get a chance to participate in the [The Rankin Bass Hexmas Crawl](https://www.prismaticwasteland.com/blog/rankin-bass-hexcrawl), but it sure looks like an exciting project. I hope to run some games in it next holiday season (probably using [this map and index](https://bakenshake09.itch.io/hexmas-map-2025) from Bakenshake). (Also, important reminder that Christmas didn't end until yesterday. It lasts for twelve days, you low church heathens!)
