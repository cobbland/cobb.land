I just redid my smartphone so that it can serve what I view as its ideal purpose, free from the app attention economy. In this effort, I came up with a list of what a smartphone should not be and what it should be.

A smartphone should not...

- Replace a regular computer
- Be an addiction machine 
- Have endlessly scrollable feeds 
- Serve mindless, algorithmic content
- Constantly demand attention
- Be distractingly colorful

My smartphone should be...

- **An atlas.** It provides navigational directions on and off the road, as well as maps for other purposes, such as stargazing.
- **A library.** It sorts, collects, and plays music, radio, and podcasts. It contains and displays ebooks and plays audio books. It plays enriching games. It serves up the news, weather, and updates. It takes, views, and organizes pictures and videos.
- **A phone.** It makes and receives calls, both voice and video, sends and receives texts and other forms of direct messaging, including email.
- **A planner.** It tells and tracks the time with clocks, alarms, timers, a calendar, and timely reminders. It collects quick thoughts, reminders, notes, and todos.
- **A toolbox.** It has other useful tools for everyday life and specific mobile-friendly tasks.
- **A wallet.** It makes and receives payments, stores membership cards and ID information, assists in managing banking, and stores passwords and other login information.

With six labeled app folders on my home screen, almost all notifications turned off, and colored set to black and white, I think I've achieved it.
