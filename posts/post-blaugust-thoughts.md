Almost two weeks late, but I figured I should post a Blaugust wrap-up. This is that.

Well, I didn't "win" Blaugust. I didn't post everyday. But I did make twelve posts, which earns me the bronze award. (Just now realizing I was only three posts and one activity away from getting silver and the community award. Ah, well.)

I had four goals for Blaugust: post everyday, avoid posting about blogging, explore all the different types of [IndieWeb posts](https://indieweb.org/posts), and participate with the Blaugust community. I'd say I succeeded in two of those goals.

As I already mentioned, I didn't post everyday. And I'm pretty sure a full half of my posts were about blogging.

No regrets! On to my successes.

I made five different types of IndieWeb posts—at least one of each: article, note, reply, bookmark, and review. (I also am all set up to post photos, but I just didn't take any worth posting.) I call that a success.

I participated in the Blaugust community. I followed and engage with bloggers on Mastodon, took part in the great blog comment debate of 2025, and added a few blogs to my regular feed reader (hi, [Nick](https://www.nicksimson.com) and [Matt](https://mtwb.blog)—and I know there are a few others, but I can't remember who you are right now). Success again!

Anyway, I don't think I'll do Blaugust again next year. It just doesn't align with my goals for this website. But it was still a lot of fun. And just the kick I needed to get this new blog going.
