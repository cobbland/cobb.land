[This topic](https://discourse.rpgcauldron.com/t/book-club-26-in-praise-of-the-6-mile-hex/3461?u=cobb.land) over on [The Cauldron](https://discourse.rpgcauldron.com/) talking about hexes (originally, in reference to [this blog post](https://steamtunnel.blogspot.com/2009/12/in-praise-of-6-mile-hex.html) has me thinking about the purpose and, by extension, size of a hex in dnd<sup><a href=#1down id="1up">1</a></sup>.

To me, hexes have always been spaces on a game board, essentially. Sure, stuff happens inside of them, but the hexes themselves are for counting movement. They're abstractions. But, to my surprise, to some (see [this blog post](https://knightattheopera.blogspot.com/2025/09/how-do-you-handle-inside-of-hex-george.html) and the referenced original linked above) they're a measuring stick for adjudicating mile-by-mile (and sometimes even more granular than that!) movement across a representational space.

Something else linked in the Cauldron topic ([this blog post](https://silverarmpress.com/down-with-the-6-mile-hex-a-modest-proposal/)) also has me rethinking my universal six-mile hex. Might three-mile be better for abstract hex maps?

These are just questions right now, but I hope I'll be able to form some coherent opinions after some more thought and discussion. More soon!
