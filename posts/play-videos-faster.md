I have a problem. Two problems, in fact. (Well, I'm sure I have more than two problems, but I'll only address the following for now.)

My first problem is that I've developed a habit of listening to podcasts and audiobooks and watching videos at two times speed. It started with wanting to finish a chapter of a book in the limited amount of time I had. But then, I realized how much more CONTENT I could CONSUME if I ticked that speed up a little bit more, then a little bit more. Now, listening to anything at normal speed makes people sound drunk and makes me feel impatient.

My second problem is that two times speed isn't fast enough anymore. Luckily, my podcatcher and audiobook player can go faster. But most video platforms online cannot. I want three times speed! (I need more speed, man. Got any of that speed on ya? Come on, man. Just help me feel good.)

Anyway, if you also have these problems—or want to have them—I can help. The following bookmarklets work on YouTube (yuck), PeerTube (better?), and maybe even elsewhere. Drag one or both and drop them into your bookmarks bar for on-demand video speed in a click (2.5x and 3x, respectively):

<a class="bookmarklet" href="javascript:void%20function(){document.getElementsByTagName(%22video%22)[0].playbackRate=2.5}();">Play fast!</a>

<a class="bookmarklet" href="javascript:void%20function(){document.getElementsByTagName(%22video%22)[0].playbackRate=3}();">Play FASTER!</a>
