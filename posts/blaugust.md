Blaugust is a month-long celebration of blogs. Participants are encouraged to post every day and to interact with each other, all to facilitate community building and the creation of genuine writing in this era of AI slop.

At least, I think that's what it's all about. I've never participated before now.

I first heard about Blaugust from Matt Bee's blog post "[Overcoming friction, gearing up for #Blaugust](https://mattbee.zone/blog/friction-and-blaugust)", then I saw it mentioned again in the [IndieWeb chat](https://indieweb.org/discuss), then it popped up again on [The Virtual Moose](https://virtualmoose.org/2025/07/31/blaugust-is-here/). After a search and reading about the event on [Nerd Girl Thoughts](https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/2025/07/10/blaugust-2025-is-coming/) (she's facilitating this year), I decided to give it a try.

What better way to inaugurate my new website than by posting every single day of August?

I'm going to try to avoid posting too many meta posts about the event and the act of bloggingâ€”that would be too easy. Instead, I plan on using this as an opportunity to explore all of the different types of [IndieWeb posts](https://indieweb.org/posts).

As for the community building aspect, I'm following the #blaugust and #blaugust2025 hashtags on the Fediverse (Mastodon or whatever) in the hopes of connecting with some cool, like-minded folks.

We'll see how it goes!
