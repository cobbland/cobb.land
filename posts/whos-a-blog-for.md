I've seen a couple posts over the past as many days in which their author complains about the lack of comment sections on other people's blogs.

Now, I'll admit that I'm new to Blaugust. It's possible that I've completely missed the point of the whole thing.

I understand a desire for a comment section. Engaging with a work in that way, especially when you feel strongly that you have something to add (or correct), can be satisfying. I often long to respond when listening to a podcast that touches on topics I have strong feelings about, especially when I either want to vehemently agree with what is being said, but—more often and even more so—when they got something very wrong.

Who is a blog for?

A blog is for the person writing it. It's for the person who built it, who's hosting it, who's spending hours tweaking it until it looks just how they want it.

If I wanted engagement, I'd be on social media. If I wanted to foster a community, I'd host a forum or my own fediverse instance. But I'm not here for either of those things. I'm here to share my thoughts with the void. If someone out there wants to share their thoughts back, I welcome their email (or, better yet, their webmention).
