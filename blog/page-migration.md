I've been digging through the bones of my old website, trying to decide what is worth resurrecting on this new one. I'm skipping over all the media lists for now, because I have BIG PLANS™ for all that. Same with recipes. And I've got a couple guides (one on writing novels and the other on prepping D&D—because I'm an expert!) and project pages that will make their way over after an edit. After all that, I present to you the following three new-old pages:

- [Sabacc](/sabacc), the best card game in a galaxy far far away
- [Shanghai Royale](/shanghai-royale), a good modification on an okay card game from right here on Earth
- [Writing Advice](/writing-advice), a collection of advice about... writing

All of this and more (to come) can be found under [More](/more). Take a look!

(I also—unrelated—joined some webrings. Find them down below amongst the 88x31 buttons.)
