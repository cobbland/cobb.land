# Chaos Beasts and Other Distractions

I plunged Cymoril, sword of legend, into the guts of another beastkin. The creature of chaos, all matted fir and twisting tusks, one of many in the horde summoned by the allies of the Necromancer, squealed in (simulated) pain. Thick blood gushed from its wound and wet my hilt and hands.

A mud-soaked field was all that remained of the once verdant woods of the Fellweald. Ahead, a tower sliced through the night sky, prismatic growths scaling its facade. The waning moon glistened in a pool of blood at my feet. The creature impaled on my blade spoke: 

"What do you say?" Tenar asked me through the dying beastkin's lips, her voice modulated by the creature’s distorted vocal chords. Hot, rancid breath moistened my cheek. "Come to space with me."

I shoved the creature free from my sword to pile atop its already dead brethren. Still more pressed towards me. These too wanted to know what my answer would be to Tenar's question.

(Tenar had won two tickets aboard a ship bound for space as part of the Last Shot program. It was still the early days of The End, when tickets aboard the great ships were practically given away to anyone who wanted them. Life had only just begun to turn bad. Later, after the Second and Third Cataclysms, exits from Earth could only be attained through scholarly merit or, more often, great wealth.)

I battled three more beastkin. Tenar posed the same question through each in turn. And I, in turn, smote each one upon my blade. I tried my best to ignore Tenar’s words even as more of the Necromancer’s creatures came bearing them.

She was relentless.

I was annoyed, bordering on angry.

(We were in virtual, fighting through the horde of enemies Tenar had prepared for us in her latest scenario—the last in a long campaign to overthrow the Necromancer. The network connection was good for now—a rarer and rarer thing in those days—but all she could think about was leaving. Still, it was better than being in phys. Nobody really cared about phys anymore—no one I knew, anyway—not when their connecting to the network and virtual was strong.)

I screamed a battle cry, more to drown out Tenar’s words than because any real feelings of bloodlust, and fought my way towards my companions.

Mad Haddy swirled madly—earning her name, as always—outstretched halberd creating a deadly cyclone around her. All who came near her, she slew. Yet come more beastkin did.

Michael the Just (though he preferred “Michael. No, Just Michael. Seriously? You’re misunderstanding me on purpose. It’s not funny.”) brought his hammer down. No helm or skull stood a chance against his might. Yet the beastkin kept coming. His once clean and polished armor was crimson and glistening with blood.

I went by Jay Cee the Enduring Advocate (in virtual). I bore the cursed blade of legend and a grand destiny weighed heavily upon my shoulders. (At least, that was the lore me and Tenar had come up with for my character.)

We were called The Three Companions.

(We were still work-shopping our name.)

Tenar was Tenar. She was our referee, our game master, and my friend. (I was the only one who knew her real name. We had been friends before we escaped to virtual.)

This was it. This was where we were supposed to be. (Here, in virtual. Not in phys. Not going to space.)

We fought towards the culmination of three years of adventuring. We'd crossed continents, overthrown kings, slayed dragons. Now, at long last, we were almost to the Necromancer’s ancient tower of chaos. I just wanted to revel in the moment, but I couldn't because another beastkin was asking me if I wanted to go to space.

Tenar was ruining it.

"No," I finally screamed as I swung my sword down with a heavy blow, splitting the skull of the latest petitioning beastkin. Hot blood splattered into my mouth. (The headset I was wearing in phys made my tongue tingle and almost-but-not-quite replicated the iron-sanguine taste.) "No, I do not want to go with you. I want to fight these beastkin, then breach that tower, then slay the Necromancer and save the realm. You know, like we planned. Is that okay with you, Tenar?"

Mad Haddy and Michael the Just had fought their way towards me in the meantime, mopping up the remnant of the horde.  Looks of confusion were visible through the gore that splattered their faces.

"What's with him?" Just Michael asked, looking questioningly between me and Mad Haddy.

Mad Haddy shrugged.

"Aren't the *beastkin* bothering you?" I asked.

"Well of course they are," Mad Haddy said as she stabbed the tip of her polearm into one that was still twitching in the moonlit mud. "They're chaos beasts."

“No, I mean—Never mind.” They didn’t get it. I guess I was the only one Tenar was ruining this for. (The price of friendship.) “Let's just get to the tower.”

"My thoughts exactly." Just Michael hefted his great war hammer onto his shoulder and led the way forward through the blood-soaked field of mud. But he skid to a halt in short order. "Oh." 

From a distance, it had looked like the tower was situated in the middle of the field. But, ahead, the field cut short, giving way to an expansive chasm. Unformed chaos boiled in the abyss. Beyond the chasm and surrounded by it, the tower stood on a pillar of earth, unreachable.

“Well, I guess that's that. You think Tenar will let us start fresh next time?” Just Michael was already reaching for his head (where his headset would be in phys, to log off). “Not that I couldn’t take a on a hundred more no problem.”

“Sure, sure.” Mad Haddy reached for her own head. “But I came pretty close to death at the end there.”

"Wait," I said. "Tenar wouldn't have set us up to fail. There has to be a way across."

Mad Haddy shrugged and spit, but stayed.

Just Michael looked at his wrist. (In his own view, a watch face would be floating there.) "Fine. Thirty more minutes. I'm getting rescanned this afternoon."

"Of course you are." Mad Haddy spat again. "Alright, Jay Cee. What's the move?"

"Do we still have that flying carpet?" I asked.

"Lemme check." Mad Haddy unswung her pack, which was by far the largest of the three we carried, and rummaged around inside. “Oh, magic rope?”

A thin silver rope snaked up her arm on its own and coiled itself around her bicycle. Haddy looked up excitedly as she stroked the rope like a pet snake.

“Nah,” I said. “To short.”

She nodded—the rope seeming to fall limp in disappointment—and returned to rummaging. “Where is that rug?”

"You’re not going to find it," Just Michael said, looking accusatorily at Mad Haddy. "We lost it under that sleeping giant, remember?"

"Don't start with me." She thrust her polearm towards the ground between his feet. He flinched away, but she was only impaling a dead beastkin in the spinal column. "How was I supposed to know it wouldn't lift Gilbert."

"Because it was a flying carpet, not a flying... something-bigger-than-a-carpet—You named the giant? Of course you named the giant."

"Of course I did." She crossed her arms. "And I named every single beastkin I slayed today, too. Just because they’re servants of chaos doesn’t mean they’re not people."

“Seriously?”

She nodded proudly.

“They’re literally not people. They don’t even have artificial intelligence. They’re simple reactive programs.”

“Tell that to Egbert here.” She twisted her weapon in the creatures neck, causing it to twitch.

“It’s going to despawn as soon as we leave.”

“I’m a person, Michael the Just,” she said in a gruff imitation of a beastkin voice. “And I’m a he. I have a husband and seventeen children.”

It was well-tread territory, so I did my best to ignore them. They'd both burn out eventually. But this was good. It meant they were invested again. And meanwhile, I knew there had to be a way to cross this chasm. My eyes traced an empty line towards the tower, up the tower, to the top of the tower.

There: a green light glowed.

"Uh, friends?" I gazed transfixed at the sickly green brilliance. "That light wasn't there before, was it?"

They were still arguing. But the light was getting brighter. And a moaning was coming from the field of battle behind us. Unformed chaos boiled in the deep and the ground shook nearly imperceptibly. 

I turned to investigate the noise, a sinking feeling in my heart.

Behind us, the beastkin, who we'd just spent the last hours killing, were twitching and moaning in the mud. The slain were rising—dead no more, but undead.

"Friends!" I shouted. "Trouble!"

They turned in unison.

"Aw, man. Come on." Just Michael moaned but hefted his axe for battle anyway.

Mad Haddy spat and did the same with her halberd.

"Hold them off," I said. "I'll find a way across the chasm."

“Still think you can take down another hundred?” Mad Haddy asked, turning to Just Micheal.

“Watch me,” Just Michael shouted as he charged, with Mad Haddy right behind him, towards the moaning undead beastkin.

I turned away from the fighting to focus on my task. Behind me, I heard weapons thump against bone and little else. Fighting the undead was a silent affair. I didn’t have to watch to know there were too many now that we weren’t fresh. We didn't have much time.

"Come on, come on," I said aloud as a paced around the edge of the chasm, looking for something—anything—that would allow us to cross to the tower. I tried looking at odd angles, in case there was an invisible walkway. I tried tossing clumps of mud into the void. I tried whispering all the passwords I knew. Nothing worked.

"Any time now," Just Michael called from too nearby, his usual jovial tone replaced by one of desperation.

I spared a look behind me. My friends were being overwhelmed and pressed back towards the chasm.

"Tenar, please." I looked towards the sky where I imagined Tenar was watching our struggle. "This isn't fair. Don't punish them because I don't want to go with you."

No response.

"Out of time," Mad Haddy shouted from right behind me—too close.

"Fine," I said to the sky. "If I say I'll go will you help us cross the chasm?"

Still no response.

But something else happened. Above the chasm pockets of air sizzled, shimmered, and solidified. The solid chunks floated, cycling from one element to another—carbon, silicon, aluminum. It was as if the building blocks of (virtual) reality couldn't decide what it wanted to be.

The sky seemed like a thin curtain, barely containing whatever waited beyond. The edges of reality frayed and fizzed. Everything dimmed.

(My physical body felt a tremor. Something was going on in the world outside of virtual. Something was wrong in phys.)

The horde of undead beastkin stopped attacking, each appearing to be stuck in its own second-long processing loop.

Just Micheal and Mad Haddy ran up to stand beside me. They looked out over the chasm at the unfolding madness.

"No way." Just Micheal shook his head vigorously. "I'm out."

Even Mad Haddy looked scared.

(There were rumors of people's minds getting lost in virtual when they stuck around in an unstable network. They weren't true. Or they probably weren't true. Regardless, it was unpleasant. My stomach boiled with nausea.)

"Don't leave yet, companions." I leapt forward with more confidence than I felt and landed on a mass of solid calcium—now iron—now nickle. It bobbed in the air but held my weight. "We have a way across."

They hesitated. Mad Haddy watched the globs of mass spanning the chasm as they cycled randomly through the elements. Just Micheal nervously eyed the undead beastkin breaking free from their loops and began to shamble forward once more.

"It's now or never," I said, hand outstretched to help them across.

Mad Haddy leapt to a nearby glitch, then grabbed my hand and pulled me onto it with her. The magic rope wrapped around her arm extended to wrap around mine as well, strengthening her grip.

“There’s a pattern,” she said before I could protest as the rope released me. “Look.”

Behind us, the blob of matter I’d been standing on evaporated into a puff of—

“Chlorine gas,” Haddy said. “Binary exponent atomic number cipher.”

I nodded my thanks, despite the fact that I had no idea what she meant and she was completely out of character.

“Mike,” she called back. “That one, then that one, then that one. Jump now!”

Micheal rolled his eyes exaggeratedly, but jumped to the blob she’d indicated just as the gnarled sword of an undead beastkin slashed the air behind him.

Together, we Three Companions crossed the chasm, leaping between the glitches in thin air. Unformed chaos churned far below us, somehow unaffected by the disruptions in the system. Above, the night sky fractured. Light leaked in. The moon waxed and waned a dozen times. Frames dropped. Time skipped. Stomachs lurched.

Mad Haddy reached the other side first. Just Micheal was right behind here. I was two jumps away when, just as suddenly as it had come undone, virtual stabilized. The shifting solid air beneath my feet puffed back into breeze. I fell.

Haddy dove for the cliff’s edge, arms extended to grab me. But I was out of reach. At least, until the magic rope wrapped around her bicep uncoiled and launched towards me.

I fumbled in the air to grasp the rope. Despite my useless groping, the rope twisted itself around my forearm. I jerked to a stop in midair, then was hurled up and over the edge of the far side of the chasm. I landed hard. (Electrical impulses tightened my abdomen, forcing me to violently expel the contents of my lungs.)

"See?" I gasped from the ground. "I knew there would be a way across."

"Tenar couldn't have planned for that." Just Michael kicked me lightly in the side. "Now get up—the tower is just ahead."

But the tower door was locked. And the prismatic growths that covered the walls of were smooth and unclimbable. And we were all tired. And the illusion was broken. 

We were in virtual while something was going bad in phys.

This was all fake.

We signed off.

%% Stopped editing here. %%

We stood before the great door—the entrance to the Necromancer’s tower. We’d been fighting our way here for months now. Finally, we’d made it.

“Hello?” Michael called into the sky.

Tenar didn’t respond.

The door didn’t budge. 

I traced up the tower with my eyes. The green light was out. The whole tower was dark. Beyond its tallest spire, stars lit the night sky which had stitched itself back together after the cracks of the glitch.

“Would you go to space?” I asked, still looking up.

“I mean,” said Micheal, “if that’s the way the campaign was going. Didn’t really sign up for scifi, though.”

“No, I mean for real.” I traced my vision between the stars, drawing constilations. “As part of the Last Shot program.”

“Sure.” Micheal shrugged. “Eventually. It’s that or die in the end, huh?” He tried to force a laugh, but it just sounded like a sob.

“If someone asked you to go on the next rocket out, though. Would you go?”

“Next one leaves in just a couple days—don’t ask me how I know that. But, no. I couldn’t make that work. I'm getting rescanned this afternoon." Michael was always getting rescanned. He was always dieting and falling off, losing and gaining five or ten pounds. Honestly, no one in virtual could tell the difference. But he was vain and/or obsessive, so he was getting rescanned. “You know it takes a few days for that to set in. No, I couldn’t go. Not yet.”

“What about you, Haddy?”

“Space?” Mad Haddy spit and shook her head. “You want to know if I’d go into space? Uh uh. No way. No thank you. Never. See, us and Earth? We've had a good long time to work all the kinks out together. Out there? I ain't gonna beta test life on another planet, man. Too many bugs." %% Go back and make her voice consistent. %%

“There aren’t actually bugs in space, Mad.” Micheal strained his voice to sound jovial. It didn’t work. “That’s just in the movies. And in virtual. Books too, I guess. In reality, there isn’t anything up there but what we bring with us.”

“Whatever, man. I ain’t going anyway.” She spit again, trying to get back into character. But it wasn’t working anymore and we all felt it. “I think I’m out for today. I think Tenar ditched us.”

“Yeah,” I said. “I hope that’s all it is.”

“I’m sure it is.” Micheal forced another laugh and almost succeeded. “I’m out, too. Getting scanned.” 

“See ya later.” I said to them and waved.

They both signed off, their avatars blinking out of existence.

I stayed, sitting beside the great door, waiting for Tenar to come back.

She never did.

///

The Three Companions returned to virtual the next day, same time and place. It still felt different---Less real. But we had to try.

%% The news should be what makes Jay Cee go check on Tenar—something to do with something near her that makes him worried she might not be safe. %%

"Did you see the news?" Micheal asked. He leaned against the tower door, absently kicking it with his heel. "Another plant---boom."

Haddy spit. "Stop talking about it. We're in virtual, so let's be in virtual."

"But it wasn't like last time," Micheal continued anyway. "I heard---"

"Mike. Stop." Mad Haddy's face and voice were humorless. Her hands were clenched tightly at her sides. "Just. Stop."

Micheal the Just held his hands up in surrender. "Fine, fine. Sorry." He stood up from the door and walked over to the edge of the chasm. "Look at them all. Just standing there. It's creepy."

Mad Haddy shrugged.

"Have you named them all yet?" Micheal asked.

"Where's Tenar?" Mad Haddy asked instead of answering. "It's been half an hour already."

"He'll be here," Micheal said cheerfully.

But I wasn't so sure. There was something weird about the way she just disepeared the day before. And it wasn't like her to be late.

"We should try to press on," I said as I stepped up to reassess the door.

"One foot of solid metal, no key hole, no visible hinges, seems less than half a milimeter." Haddy counted on her fingers as she rattled off door detail. "Anti-magic charm, warding charm, Charm of---"

"What she's saying," Micheal inturrupted, "it it's unopenable. At least, until Tenar shopes up with a hint."

///

///

I took my headset off and returned to phys. The “real” world. I had to find out what happened to Tenar—REAL NAME.

///

%% By the end of the first section, Jay Cee is concerned enough to go look in on Tenar. He finds her dead. When he returns for the next section---the tower---he keeps this information to himself until the time is right. By the end of the tower, he's decided to go to space. By the end of the drive, he's decided to stay. %%

There she was. Dead. 

///

TKTK was dead. It wasn’t because of the First Retaliation—no, nothing so grand as all that. He’d just died in virtual. It was still early in the Great Disaster, but late enough that no one official was all too worried about collecting bodies.

///

It felt weird: knowing something about someone they would never know themselves. They could never learn how they had died. But I knew.

///

They were launching so many in those days that the usual sites couldn’t support the demand. Cape Canaveral was booked solid. They were using the one in California and the new one in Texas. They’d built another in Ohio—long past worrying about the risks.

That’s where TKTK’s tickets—my tickets now—were for: Ohio.

***

%% He packs a small bag, grabs the tickets, and leaves. He drives through the mountains of wv, crosses flat ohio, pulls over somewhere along Lake Eerie where he can see the launch site. He's not going. To go would be to return to another fantasy. He's decided to live. The end. %%

%% I don't want the story to say playing pretend is bad, though. It's pro dnd. And pro space. But also, pro living. More importantly pro living. What does that mean in context? I don't know. %%


The morning fog had risen to bury the tops of the mountains, making the valley feel more like a grand cave, making the road like the long path through the Mines of Moria.

///

But this wasn’t the journey, I realized as a pulled onto I-70. I’d already taken the journey. This trip was just perfunctory. The decision was already made. I’d made it back in that tower. But I kept going anyway. I drove until I was on the shores of Lake Eerie, at the gate of the port to the stars. I could see the rocket from here—I was close enough.

///

This was the same. Running away from reality again.

I decided not to go.

After all, TKTK.
