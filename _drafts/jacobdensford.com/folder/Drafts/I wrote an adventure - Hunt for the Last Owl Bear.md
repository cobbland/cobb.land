# I wrote an adventure: Hunt for the Last Owl Bear

![](/_stuff/attachments/hunt_mockup.jpg)

I wrote an adventure module—[Hunt for the Last Owl Bear](https://cobbland.itch.io/hunt-for-the-last-owl-bear)—as part of the [Knave 2e Adventure Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/knave-2e-adventure-jam), which [came in third place](https://itch.io/jam/knave-2e-adventure-jam/results) according to the votes of everyone else who participated, and [got an honorable mention](https://youtu.be/jETcIgX6Nb0?si=YPffFk3WbjnVKbxI&t=694) by Questing Beast, aka Ben Milton. (It was also reviewed by Bryce Lynch of tenfootpole.org—more on that later.)
