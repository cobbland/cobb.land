I've been either running games or being a player in a game for 13 years. Started as a dm with no experience as a teenager running dnd 4e, then moved to both 3.5 and 5e around the same time a few years later. I've run some other rpgs but it's been mainly dnd the whole time. I've also coached new dm's online a far bit on reddit but haven't touched that in a while.

Right now I understand that production value is relatively sought after due to the popularity of live play games and podcasts, and I'm fine with that with my media background.

My biggest issue right now besides grabbing the A/V equipment I'd like, is the part of me that balks at the idea of people willingly paying $20-30 for a game every week or 2. It's the same as takeout essentially but because I've never needed to pay someone, there's a part of me that doesn't understand why people do, even if logically it makes sense. Don't know if that's imposter syndrome or what but it's something I've yet to be able to rationalize. Another issue is that I personally hate 5e and think the system is poorly designed for dm's, and WotC see us as cash cows and don't respect the health of the game over their bottom line. So running games online is a challenge for me personally as 5e is the most common, entry level system, but I suppose if people pay me to do it I can get over myself.

### My Answer

I'd love to answer your questions. I will try to be as brief as is helpful, but I do have A LOT of opinions and advice concerning this topic. I hope some of it is useful.

I ran (note the past tense—more on that soon) games professionally for about nine months, starting from the beginning of this year and going to about the end of September. I mainly ran D&D 5E and Old-School Essentials (a rewriting of the D&D Basic/Expert rules from the olden times). Those are the games I had ongoing campaigns in. But I also ran one-shots of a few other systems with varying levels of success. I ran it all online. (It seems to be that the VAST majority of players only want to play D&D 5E. I'd imagine you could stick to just that game and have plenty of success. I have the same opinion of the game as it seems you do. I'd rather run almost anything else. And there are people running other games successfully! I'd recommend starting with trying to get two campaigns off the ground—one in 5E and the other in a preferred system, and see which one takes off. In my case, they both did!)

I used Discord for voice, video, and text chat (strongly recommend setting up your own Discord server for this); [Owlbear Rodeo](https://www.owlbear.rodeo/) for a virtual tabletop (highly recommend Owlbear, especially if you're burnt out on Roll20). I also used [LegendKeeper](https://www.legendkeeper.com/) for a shareable world bible (this proved to be overkill and now I would recommend just having a channel in your Discord to share lore and such). I (begrudgingly) used D&D Beyond for character sheets. Oh, and for bonus points I used [dddice](https://dddice.com/) for 3d dice (with some finagling you can integrate it with both Owlbear and D&D Beyond—but, like LegendKeeper, this is probably overkill).

I skipped right over trying to advertise my games and just used [StartPlaying](https://startplaying.games/). For my time and money, it's worth the cut they take to have built-in access to so many players. The players come to you! And they take care of all the payment processing and all of that nonsense. It usually takes a couple weeks for a game to fill, so I'd definitely suggest running campaigns over one-shots.

I let the players come to me. But I will vet them a bit, especially if they're coming into an ongoing campaign. I use Google Forms for a quick onboarding survey. I can usually tell based on that if they're going to be a good fit for my games or not. (But if you find one player is ruining the fun for everyone else, kick them out and refund their money—better to lose one player than all the rest.) Depending on the game, my table size was between three and six—and I wouldn't run a game for less than three players because it was no longer worth it financially. For 5E, I found four to be a good spot. For easier games to run, I've gone as high as eight, though I prefer to cap out at six. Since you're charging per player, their is a temptation to run for more and more people at a time, but the game's quality definitely starts to take a hit around five in my experience. But, again, depends on the game.

Here is where I went wrong, why I burned out, and why I stopped running professional games (for now). I crafted custom adventures for each campaign I ran. This simply took too much time, making the economics of the whole thing not work. My plan for when I get back to it, and what I would recommend to you, is to run published campaigns. Definitely dig through them, cutting and pasting liberally, making them your own. But then run that same campaign over and over and over again. That way, you have one big prep for the first campaign, and then just little hour or two prep sessions for all the rest. It seems like that's the only way to make this thing work financially.

I charged $15-30 per player per session. Only you can decide what your time is worth. For me, I wanted to make at least $15 an hour. But remember—and this is where I failed—you have to include your prep time. So, assuming you're running a published campaign, are a decently fast reader, and have experience with your VTT, budget in about an hour of prep per hour of play. That is my plan going forward, anyway.

The way I try to look at pro games: they're paying for someone to run games for them, either because they don't have friends who want to play or they do but none of them want to run a game. I never provided a Critical Role level experience, and I don't think any of my players ever expected me to. As much as I could, I treated them like any regular players I would have around my table in regular life. Sure, the dynamic is a little different since they are your customers, but this was the best way I found to do it for my own sanity. Also, obviously, safety tools. They are after all actually strangers. The best way to handle that is to have robust safety tools in play.

Another mistake I made that perhaps you can learn from is I made myself available on the Discord all day every day. That wasn't sustainable, and it was hard to walk it back once the precedent was set. I'd recommend having "office hours" where you're available to players between sessions—maybe an hour a day or something. But don't be like me! Boundaries! 

I hope there was something helpful in all that rambling. If you have any more questions or if I missed something, feel free to shoot me an email. (But I'm going to be off the grid for the next few days for the holidays.) And I'd love to hear how it goes once you get started. Good luck!
