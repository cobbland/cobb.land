# Death News

<span class="firstletter">N</span><span class="firstwords">el walked down a narrow</span> hallway lined with apartment doors and exposed pipes. The walls rumbled with the vibrations of a passing freight elevator, already dim lighting darkening further in response to the elevator’s magnetic field.

According to Nel’s poorly-kept records, the Kid had lived here with his mother in Spoke Four, not far from Nel’s own place. Except the Kid’s was even closer to the hub. Gravity was barely over point three. The block was a real discount joint. There were only a few reasons for a terry to end up living in a place like this. None of them good.

A gaggle of children bounced down the hallway. Nel flattened against the wall to let them pass. They were loud and thin and dirty, with the chemical piss smell of clothes washed in poorly recycled water. One of them bumped the Kid’s duffel, knocking it loose from Nel’s grip.

Nel swore as the duffel’s closure gave out and the Kid’s detritus ricocheted down the hallway.

“Sorry, *zemlyanin*,” a ratty-haired girl with big eyes stopped long enough to say before following her giggling companions.

“I’m not a damned *zemlyanin,*” Nel yelled after her. She jabbed a finger at the words on the chest of her jumpsuit. “See this? I’m a ship captain. Hear me? Not a *zemlyanin.”*

The children paid Nel no more attention as they continued on their way.

“Ah, whatever.”

Nel continued down the hallway, snatching up the Kid’s belongings as she went and jamming them back into the duffel. Eye drops, gravity bands, pills for space sickness. It was terry stuff, alright.

“He was the *zemlyanin*.” She muttered to herself. “Not me.”

She reached the door to the Kid’s apartment just as she grabbed the last item: a paper book—a real paper book with a real leather cover. On the front, an embossed golden cross and lettering that read, “Reunified Good News Bible.”

“‘You must not eat from it, and you must not touch it, or else you will die.’” The words came unbidden to Nel’s lips from some deep childhood memory, from the tattered Reunified Good News Bible—also made of real paper, though without the leather cover—her father kept on a special table in the corner of their apartment in the greenstacks on Teegarden. She wondered if this book smelled the same as her father’s had: dust and years and earth and history. And lies.

She shook off the past, stuffed the book into the duffel without sniffing it, and stepped up to the door. The surface display showed a generic Christmas greeting despite it being standard June. A cross hung above it.

Nel keyed the intercom. She pulled the datawork up on her scroll while she waited—a life reduced to so many forms.

The display resolved into the face of a woman with wide, hard features. The festive greeting burned into the screen obscuring her eyes. “Yes?”

“Mix—” Nel looked down at her scroll for the Kid’s last name. “—Dawson?”

“Who’s askin’?” The woman had a strong Martian terry accent. The Kid hadn’t. He must have worked hard to hide it.

“I’m Captain Vega of the Macondo,” Nel announced herself formally, as she always did when delivering such news. It was automatic after so many times. “Are you—” She checked the name again. “—Isaac Dawson’s mother?”

“Isaac.” The woman shifted back and forth, trying to see around Nel through the feed. “Is he with you? Expectin’ him back this cycle.”

“Can I come in?” Nel asked. “I just need you to sign a few things. Won’t take long.”

“Where’s my son?” she asked without opening the door.

Nel paused for a long moment, hoping the woman would relent. When she didn’t, Nel said, “I have his things.”

The sound of several locks unbolting came from the other side of the door before it finally slid open. Nel stepped inside. Humid air enveloped her, and a sight greeted her that made her skin itch. Green life covered every surface. Plants lined the walls, sat on shelves, and protruded from alcoves. Leafy vines twisted up the legs of the modest dining table and the sides of the hard-looking couch. Everything was dirty. Everything was damp.

The woman—all weathered skin and stout bone wrapped in tattered garments—snatched the Kid’s duffel and cradled it to her chest. She blocked Nel from entering further. Grow lights shined from every direction, swallowing any shadow she might have cast. Nothing could hide in that harsh, buzzing light.

The woman looked between the duffel and Nel, back and forth as if trying to find the missing link between the two. After a long moment, she stepped aside stiffly. “Come in.”

As Nel stepped hesitantly inside, the grow lights reignited her skin. She remembered the feeling from her youth, only the lights in her memory were industrial grade. She remembered the constant itch. She remembered coming home after a day working in the greenstacks, her skin raw and peeling from the ultraviolet rays and chemical fertilizers.

Nel stood in those harsh lights, tightening her braid, lost in her memories of the greenstacks. There was nowhere to hide in those fields stacked on fields stacked on fields. She had worked those fields just like her parents and their parents had. Unlike them, Nel had gotten out. She’d escaped and brought her brother with her. What a terrible mistake that had been.

“Make yourself at home.” The woman had an edge to her voice that made it clear she didn’t mean it. She laid the duffel on the couch, her movements unsteady. “I’ll go on ahead and put the kettle on.”

“That isn’t necessary,” Nel said from right inside the door. “I just need you to sign a few things.”

“Nonsense.” The woman was already busying herself at a narrow slice of plant-covered counter in an alcove that passed for a kitchen. There, a single induction burner with an ancient-looking kettle sat nestled among the greenery. She filled the kettle from a cistern above the counter—probably blackmarket water—retrieved a tin from a cabinet and dumped a portion of its powdery contents into the kettle, and returned the kettle to the burner. “Well, stop haunting my doorway and sit somewhere. Anywhere is fine.”

Nel glanced around the apartment. Her seat options were limited to the soil-stained couch next to the duffel or one of two vine-covered chairs pushed up to the dining table. She compromised and stood behind one of the chairs.

“Y’all taking his soul weren’t enough, huh?” the woman said, trying and failing to sound friendly and casual. Her shoulders held tension, razor-sharp blades straining to cut through her threadbare shirt. “Had to take his life, too.”

The Church of Saint Ethan the Reunifier taught that the greatest sin was to cross the Bridge. To cross was to lose one’s soul. Nel had long ago decided that it was a lie the Church perpetuated for the benefit of the Conglomerate. If employees were too scared to bridge, they would never leave. They would have no choice but to accept whatever bad deal was offered.

“He was brave and…” Nel began giving the generic prepared speech she always gave. She’d read it in a book once.

“Oh, save it for someone shoppin’.” The woman snatched two mugs off a pair of wall hooks and slammed them down on the counter. “I ain’t buyin’. I know…” Her shoulders heaved. She straightened the mugs before continuing. “I *knew* my son better than most. He wasn’t brave. He was a fool.”

For an instant, Nel felt compelled to defend the Kid as his captain. The feeling passed before she could act on it.

“And you—” The woman spun towards Nel, her sudden movement knocking the tea tin from the countertop. It drifted to the soil-scattered floor and clattered against the hard surface, spilling its contents. Brown powder mixed with dirt.

“Mix Dawson, really. I only need—”

“Oh, I know what you need,” the woman said with cold menace. “I only hope you don’t kill any more children before you get it.”

“Now, just a minute.” Nel jabbed a finger at the other woman. “You don’t know a single thing about me. I should—”

The kettle whistled. Steam erupted into the already humid air. The noise and the moisture cut through the growing tension, defusing the room.

The woman’s shoulder slumped as she turned and lifted the kettle from the burner.

“Mix Dawson,” Nel said more softly. “I only need you to sign a few things.”

“Please, call me Rebecca. Mix Dawson was my mother’s name.” She filled the two cups with brownish liquid and set them on the small dining table to steam among the plants that dominated its surface. “Let it never be spoke that Becky Dawson doesn’t provide tea for her guests, even if they are bridger captains.”

When Rebecca said “bridger” she crossed herself protectively. Out of habit, Nel crossed herself in return. She didn’t really believe it meant anything. Not anymore. But bridgers were a superstitious bunch—they would take any edge they could get—and Nel wasn’t immune to the desire for luck.

Rebecca cradled her arms around her waist. Neither woman moved to sit or drink the tea. They looked more similar than Nel cared to admit. Both had tanned skin. Both were stout from growing up down a gravity well. Nel wouldn’t look that different from Rebecca, given a couple dozen hard years.

“How did my son die?” Rebecca finally asked.

“There was a fire. The Kid—Isaac. He…” Nel was surprised to find her words caught in her throat. Long-buried emotions threatened to well up inside her. “There was a fire.”

“I suppose I should be proud.” Rebecca sighed. “The missionaries do it, after all. They bridge, sacrificing their souls to save others. In a way, that’s what all you bridgers are doing.”

“Sure,” Nel said. “Sort of.”

“I suppose I am proud, in my own way. What about your parents?” Rebecca put a bony hand on Nel’s shoulder. “Are they proud of you, I mean.”

The tea sat, forgotten and growing cold.

“I just need you to sign a few things,” Nel said, shrugging off the other woman’s hand. She stepped back and swiped the datawork from her scroll towards Rebecca. The other woman’s scroll pinged, indicating receipt.

“Fine,” Rebecca said, turning as cold as the tea would be soon. She unrolled her scroll and got to signing.
