## Posts

- Add the [post](post.md) template, adding tags and making sure the date is right.
- Move to the "Posts" folder to publish.

### Images

- Image names should be all lowercase, with underscores instead of spaces.
- Images should be compressed JPGs, SVGs, or PNGs (when transparency is needed).

#### Imbedding Images

Images must be imbedded thusly:
