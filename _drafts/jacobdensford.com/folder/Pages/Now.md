# Now

<span class="firstletter">R</span><span class="firstwords">ight at this very moment</span>, I'm probably procrastinating when I should be writing Centauri Womb. That procrastination is currently taking the form of: 

- Reading through all the Cosmere novels by Brandon Sanderson (waiting for the new Stormligh to come out), all the Star Wars novels from the ‘90s and ‘00s, and the books of Appendix N.
- Trying off and on to learn Thai.
- Practicing typing with the Colemak layout.
