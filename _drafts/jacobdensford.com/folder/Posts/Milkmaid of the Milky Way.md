# Milkmaid of the Milky Way

![](/_stuff/attachments/milkmaid.png)

I thought I'd try adventure games again,  
So I purchased this one up from a sale.  
At two hours long, should not cause me much pain.  
I can finish before the moonrise, pale.

You play a girl atop a fjord so green,  
With cattle she milks to make butter and cheese.  
'Til a flying ship takes them in the sheen  
Of its magic beam, locked up without keys.  

The story, music, and art are all quite nice.  
You are a hero in this tragic tale.  
I was even moved to tears once or twice.  
And challenging puzzlesâ€”I did not fail.  

The dialogue is told in rhyme resplendent.  
Hence this review sonnet. **I recommend it.**
