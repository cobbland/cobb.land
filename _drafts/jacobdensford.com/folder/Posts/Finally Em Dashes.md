# Finallyâ€”Em Dashes

<span class="firstletter">T</span><span class="firstwords">his might be the most</span> important thing I've ever posted on the internet.

Before today, every time I needed to type an em dash, I would do one of the following: copy and paste it from the [Wikipedia page for dashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash), hold alt and type 0151 on my numpad, or wait until the end and replace all "--" with em dashes using search and replace combined with one of the first two methods.

No more!

Today, I discovered a little utility called [Em-n-en](https://cemrajc.github.io/em-n-en/), which adds options for shortcut keys and inline replacement. Now, I can add an em dash by hitting ctrl+alt+shift+- or by typing \==-.

So much better. My life will never be the same. And neither will yours.

Welcome to the future.
