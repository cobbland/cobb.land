I've seen a few Blaugust posts over the past as many days in which their authors bemoan the lack of comment sections on other people's blogs. I'm writing this response post in lieu of leaving a comment (and undermining my entire thesis).

Who is a blog for?

A blog is for its author. Engagement and community are byproducts, and not always welcome ones, and certainly not ones the author is obligated to host.

Let me explain.

But first, a disclaimer:

I'll admit that I'm new to Blaugust. It's possible that I've completely missed the point of the whole thing. In fact, I think I have. Looking more into its history, it seems that a large part of the event was encouraging new bloggers by commenting on their blog posts. It is/was also mostly centered around video games—more specifically, MMORPGs. I'm not sure how word of the event spread into the more indieweb-y, static-site-generator-y crowd (if such a thing can even be considered a "crowd"), and I understand how it feels to have a bunch of new folks who don't get the established culture invading your space, but here we are. As such, I'm only writing in a general sense, and not addressing the Blaugust event specifically.

Okay, back to it:

Who is a blog for?

Before I can really answer the *who*, I must address the *what*.

What is a blog?

I'll tell you what it's not. A blog is not social media. And it shouldn't be.

What is a blog?

A blog is not a public forum.

I understand a desire for a comment section. Engaging with a work in that way, especially when you feel strongly that you have something to add (or correct), can be satisfying. I often long to respond when listening to a podcast that touches on topics I have strong feelings about, especially when I either want to vehemently agree with what is being said, but—more often and even more so—when they got something very wrong.

So what is a blog?

Enough of that question. I'm not actually answering it. The question I'm posing is:

Who is a blog for?

A blog is for the person writing it. It's for the person who built it, who's hosting it, who's spending hours tweaking it until it looks just how they want it.

If I wanted engagement, I'd be on social media. If I wanted to foster a community, I'd host a forum or my own fediverse instance. But I'm not here for either of those things. I'm here to share my thoughts with the void. If someone out there wants to share their thoughts back, I welcome their email (or, better yet, their webmention).
