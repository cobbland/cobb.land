I have a confession to make. I lied. Sort of. In my previous post (<a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://cobb.land/posts/whos-a-blog-for/">Who's a blog for?</a>) I said I wasn't here for engagement or community. I stand by everything I said in the context of a blog having a comments section. But there is one area where engagement and community are something I really enjoy: Being part of an ongoing conversation that spans multiple blogs and posts and authors.

Right now, the topic du jour is blog comments. And I've already read over half a dozen related posts, some of which mentioned this very website. (My most recent and maybe favorite post on the subject was [Rabbit](https://jackalope.city/)'s [Blaugust Notes on Comments](https://talk.jackalope.city/talk/blaugust-notes-on-comments/).)

Normally, all of these related posts would be lost to me. But in the case of Blaugust, and thanks to [owl](https://godless-internets.org/about)'s [Blaugust 2025 OPML](https://godless-internets.org/2025/08/01/blaugust-2025-opml), I've added just over one hundred feeds to my reader. It's impossible to read everything coming through that hose, but I have been at least skimming all the relevant posts.

Webmentions<sup><a href=#1down id="1up">1</a></sup>!

Even without webmentions (but y'all really should be using webmentions),

To get technical, this site uses [Webmention.io](https://webmention.io/) and [webmention.app](https://webmention.app/) for receiving and sending webmentions, as well as [Bridgy](https://brid.gy/) for connecting to Mastodon (and sometimes Bluesky).
