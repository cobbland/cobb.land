My first game console was the Super Nintendo. I got it for my birthday just as the N64 was coming out. It didn't bother me at all that I was rocking last-gen hardware—a benefit of the pre-social-media age, most likely—because I finally had a Nintendo!

You'd think that among my first few games I collected, I would have the critically acclaimed The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. But, as mentioned above, this was a different time. I didn't know or care at all about Zelda. Instead, I had Super Mario All-Stars, Donkey Kong Country, the Super Star Wars trilogy, and... ClayFighter??? I'm not complaining. I loved those games and played them to death. Even ClayFighter. But, in retrospect, my collection was seriously lacking.

Thirty-ish years later, I'm neck deep in retro console emulation and ready to rectify my childhood mistakes.

And, boy, was I missing out. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past is great! Though I can also see why my younger self might have skipped it. Compared to Mario, Donkey Kong, and Luke Skywalker platforming across dynamic 2D landscapes (not to mention Bad Mister Frosty pummeling Taffy with his icy fists), Link's top-down traversal of Hyrule and—let's be real—clunky combat could feel a little underwhelming. But maybe that just goes to show how shallow little me was. Because beneath all that is a rich experience for a kid (or grown adult) willing to spend some time exploring its depths.

Speaking of depths... I love these dungeons! I almost feel as if I've explored them all before, and I mean that in a good way. Either because of their brilliant construction or because of the influence this franchise has had on the rest of gaming—or, more likely, both—each puzzle, twist, and loop felt satisfying and inevitable.

The game also introduces more depth with its RPG mechanics. Though light and lacking in any real progression choice, other than the order in which you explore the world, they offered just enough interest to keep me poking into every corner of the map. (Still, I missed a single heart piece, dang it!)

I took my time with this game. I spent over a year (despite what the above dates indicate) slowly working my way through Hyrule and the Dark World. I looked forward to powering on my old CRT TV once a week or so for a cozy hour of saving princesses. I savored every minute.

This was a very good game, even by modern standards. **I strongly recommend it.**
