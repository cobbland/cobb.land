This is one of my favorite books by one of my favorite authors, and one of only a handful of books I've read more than once. While its progressive-at-the-time notions of gender feel almost quaint now, I feel it still has something to say to a modern reader. Plus Game of Thrones has nothing on this political intrigue. **I strongly recommend it.**
