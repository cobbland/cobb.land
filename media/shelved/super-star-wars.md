I was gifted this and the rest of the Super Star Wars trilogy along with my Super Nintendo for my eighth birthday (or somewhere around there). Super Star Wars was the only one of the three I didn't beat as a kid. Unlike the later two games, it doesn't have level codes, so when you get a game over you have to start again from the beginning.

I'm sure this game was great at the time of its release—I even remember enjoying it back then, despite not being able to finish it. But, other than the nostalgia and fact that it's Star Wars, I didn't love it this time around, and I wouldn't have had the patience to finish it if it hadn't been for savestates. 

The run and gun gameplay was frustrating. I just want to keep my healthbar full and to clear the stage of enemies. But the baddies keep respawning and everything throws of little bits of shrapnel that constantly chip away at your health. Finding Obi-Wan and getting your lightsaber was a cool moment, though. As was flying your x-wing down the Death Star trench. But I think the genre just isn't for me.

At least it's pretty short. **I recommend it with reservations.**
