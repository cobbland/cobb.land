Is it a *good* book? I don't know. Is it a *fun* book? Absolutely yes! I wasn't interested in this book or its genre at all, but I kept hearing about Dungeon Crawler Carl everywhere, and with every mention came praise. So finally I thought, "I play D&D. I like dungeons." And even though it's more video game dungeons than D&D dungeons, those two concepts often bleed together anyway. Surprising even myself, **I recommend it**.
