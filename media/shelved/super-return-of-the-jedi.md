It could be argued that Return of the Jedi is the weakest of the original Star Wars trilogy. The same could be said for the Super Star Wars trilogy of Super Nintendo games. And yet, just like when I was a kid, I enjoyed the last one the most. Though it wasn't because it was the best game of the trilogy—it was just the easiest.

Listen, I like platformers, but I don't think I like run and gun games. So, despite almost all of the reviewers online listing each game in this trilogy among the best Super Nintendo games of all time, they're just not for me.

I still enjoyed playing through them, though. The music and sound effects tickled my brain in a pleasantly nostalgic way. The pixelated renditions of scenes from the movies where expertly done. And this game the most among the trilogy was technically impressive—Escaping aboard the Millennium Falcon through the guts of the second Death Star as it exploded all around me was truly exhilarating.  

Did I love every minute? No. Do I think they're great games? Yeah, probably. Just not for me. **I recommend it with reservations.**
