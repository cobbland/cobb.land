The sequel is better than the original in this case (as with the movies, arguably). Super Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is an improvement on [Super Star Wars](/media/shelved/super-star-wars/) in almost every way.

Now there are level codes to get back to where you left off, force powers (though somehow I missed most of them), and special moves for Han and Chewie (grenades and a spin—how fancy). In general, the level design is better. And I actually managed to figure out the bosses well enough this time around to beat them without taking too much damage (except for the one on Cloud City that I cheesed by one-hitting with a thermal detonator).

There were a few parts with jumps so annoying that I ended up reloading a savestate a dozen times (I still don't have the patience required to beat these games the old fashioned way—I definitely would have gotten at least three game overs). And the final fight with Darth Vader was long and brutal but still kind of fun.

This game was pretty good. **I recommend it with reservations.**
