I blasted through [Enshittification](https://bookshop.org/p/books/enshittification-why-everything-suddenly-got-worse-and-what-to-do-about-it-cory-doctorow/d3f8483b158906ce) by [Cory Doctorow](https://pluralistic.net) in just three days. It was a great, if mostly infuriating, read. I was already familiar with Doctorow and his idea of [enshittifiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification), but it was illuminating to see the whole concept and what's actually happening laid out in so much detail. And it was mildly uplifting to see the positive changes slowly being made recently. My only problem with the book is it got me all riled up but didn't leave me with a call to action. What do I do now, Cory?! **I recommend it.**
