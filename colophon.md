This website was mostly crafted by hand in HTML and CSS (with a tiny bit of non-essential JavaScript for fun stuff) using <a href="https://vscodium.com/">VSCodium</a> and generated using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). It's hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and deployed from <a href="https://github.com/cobbland/cobb.land">Github</a> (for now).</a>

[Webmention.io](https://webmention.io/) and [webmention.app](https://webmention.app/) are used for receiving and sending webmentions, as well as [Bridgy](https://brid.gy/) for connecting to Mastodon (and sometimes Bluesky).

The current design is inspired by the [GEOS operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEOS_(8-bit_operating_system)) ([more screenshots](https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/geosc64)) for the Commodore 64. Colors are mostly from [Calculating the color palette of the VIC II](https://www.pepto.de/projects/colorvic/).
