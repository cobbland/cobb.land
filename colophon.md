This website was mostly crafted by hand in HTML and CSS (with a tiny bit of non-essential JavaScript for fun stuff) using <a href="https://vscodium.com/">VSCodium</a> and generated using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). It's hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and deployed from <a href="https://github.com/cobbland/cobb.land">Github</a> (for now).</a>

The current design is inspired by the [GEOS operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEOS_(8-bit_operating_system)) for the Commodore 64. Colors are from [Calculating the color palette of the VIC II](https://www.pepto.de/projects/colorvic/) (when I eventually add color).

I use [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) for some simple, unobtrusive analytics just for fun. (Disable JavaScript or add GoatCounter to your ad blocker if you want to avoid theseâ€”I won't be offended.)
