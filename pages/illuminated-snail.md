[Illuminated Snail](https://illuminatedsnail.com) is both a collective and a publisher.

**The Order of the Illuminated Snail** is a group of like-minded individuals who talk about, play, and create tabletop roleplaying games together. We hangout on the [Illuminated Snail Forum](https://forum.illuminatedsnail.com/).

**Illuminated Snail Press** is a little indie tabletop roleplaying game imprint. Some notable works include:

- [Hunt for the Last Owlbear](https://illuminatedsnail.itch.io/hunt-for-the-last-owl-bear): A Thailand-inspired fantasy hex crawl adventure
- [Peasant](https://illuminatedsnail.itch.io/peasant): A tiny adventure game (for introducing new players to dnd)
- [Fell](https://illuminatedsnail.itch.io/fell): A new old-school adventure game (my take on an [Odd](https://freeleaguepublishing.com/games/into-the-odd/)-like)
