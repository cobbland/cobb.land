[Illuminated Snail Press](https://illuminatedsnail.com) is my little indie tabletop roleplaying game imprint, currently only publishing stuff by me.

**Some notable works**:

- [Hunt for the Last Owlbear](https://illuminatedsnail.itch.io/hunt-for-the-last-owl-bear): A Thailand-inspired fantasy hex crawl adventure
- [Peasant](https://illuminatedsnail.itch.io/peasant): A tiny adventure game (for introducing new players to dnd)
- [Fell](https://illuminatedsnail.itch.io/fell): A new old-school adventure game (my take on an [Odd](https://freeleaguepublishing.com/games/into-the-odd/)-like)
